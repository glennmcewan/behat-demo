# Behat Playground

Playground environment for learning how to set up and install Behat with the Selenium driver, utilising Grid and Chrome driver.

An assumption is made that you'll be running this in a Virtual Machine configured with PHP -- this means that the Selenium Grid will be running **inside** of the VM, and you'll need to register a *node* (a worker) to the Selenium Grid from the host machine. The node is the worker which will launch a visual browser and perform the Selenium tests, whilst being driven by Selenium Grid on the VM.

Another assumption is that you are running this on Windows.

## Dependencies

- Virtualised Environment (Vagrant, Docker, whatever...)
- Composer (https://getcomposer.org/)
- Selenium Standalone Server (host and guest machines both need a copy)
- Chromedriver (or any other chosen driver, but this repo is currently configured for Chromedriver)

## Getting up and running

- Clone this repository locally in your VM of choice

- Change directory into the cloned repository and run `composer install` to install the dependencies from the lock file

- Boot up Selenium Grid in the guest / VM:

- - `java -jar /path/to/selenium-server-standalone.jar -role hub`

- Once the Selenium Grid is running in the guest, register a Selenium Grid Node from the host machine (and update the placeholders in the example below):

- `java -jar /path/to/selenium-server-standalone.jar -role node -hub http://{IP_OF_VM}:4444/grid/register -Dwebdriver.chrome.driver="/path/to/chromedriver.exe" -browser "browserName=chrome,version=ANY,maxInstances=5,platform=WINDOWS"`

- Now you should have Selenium Grid set up and running with one registered node. Back in to the VM...

- Change in to this repo's directory and run `vendor/bin/behat` which will execute the Behat tests -- loading up a Chrome browser window on the host machine
